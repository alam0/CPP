	From the user's perspective my programs (main.cpp, mortgage.cpp, mortgage.h) are meant to easily store and process multiple personal mortgages. The user can construct a class using their own values "mortgage classname(principal, rate, payment);" or construct with default values with the "mortgage classname;" Then the user can "credit" amounts from a principal and amortize mortgages as well.
	Internally, a class called mortgage is created in mortgage.h with constructors, member function prototypes, and variables. The mortgage.h file is used in mortgage.cpp where the constructors and functions are defined. The amortize function was the most difficult part, involving correct calculation of each interest value through a while loop and an if statement for the last payment. The mortgage.h function was also used in the main driver function. The makefile compiles all 3 files and creates an executable.
	I evaluated the program for correctness by checking the results with the examples provided in the prelab sheet. I verified that the program provided correct results.
