The repository 'mario_game' currently has firstmilestone.cpp, a makefile, and some sprites

Personal Time Log
3 Hours SDL tutorial
1 Hour makefile and firstmilestone.cpp
3 Hours Group Meeting (Inheritance hierarchy)

I worked on the makefile and firstmilestone.cpp. I went through a solid portion of the LazyFoo tutorials which took longer than I thought. In our group meeting we clearly laid out the inheritance hierarchy. The code for firstmilestone.cpp and the makefile is largely based on the tutorials we went through.

This project to recreate Super Mario seems very challenging, but fun and worth the experience. My final project for Fundamentals of Computing I also worked with graphics. The gfx library provided by Professor Bualuan was great to work with. It's pretty exciting to take it the next level with SDL2 and a great group of friends. The new syntax and commands to use SDL2 makes it confusing with new error messages, but office hours and piazza are very helpful.
